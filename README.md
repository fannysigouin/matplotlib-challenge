Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals Inc.

This challenge seeks to provide Pymaceuticals' executive team with tables and figures needed for a technical report of their clinical study on mice. 
The following results have been generated in the pymaceuticals.ipynb file:
Summary statistics of the mice data, including the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and SEM.
Bar charts plotting the total number of timepoints for mice tested for each drug regimen, using both Pandas and pyplot.
Pie charts showing the distributino of female vs male mice, using both Pandas and pyplot.
Box plot showing the distribution of the final tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
Outliers for each of the above drug regimens.
Scatter plot showing the average tumor volume vs mouse weight for the Capomulin drug regimen.
Line plot showing the average tumor volume vs time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.
Correlation coefficient and linear regression calculated for the mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen.
